# Week 9 - Career Week

## In Class Assignment due Friday, Oct 15, 2020 @ 8pm
- None. Keep working on your mini projects if you didn't have the chance to finish!

## Homework due Wednesday, Oct 21, 2020 @ 5:30pm

- Complete [DataCamp Course: Introduction to Statistics in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-statistics-in-python)
    - Advertised as 4 hours. It is usually less in my experience.
    - Honor system in Canvas as usual. 
    - Bring your questions to class! 

### For Fun (Optional)

- Take [DataCamp Assessment: Statistic Fundamentals with Python](https://assessment.datacamp.com/statistics-fundamentals-with-python)
    - 15 question timed assessment that is in no way indicative of real-life DS work, but it might be fun to test your knowledge / frantic googling skills to try to find the meaning of function parameters. Might cover libraries we haven't covered yet, so don't be discouraged. 
    - For those new to statistics with Python, I suggest completing the above course first. Otherwise, feel free to dive in to get ideas on future statistics courses in DataCamp.  

### For Those Who Need Re-Introduction to Probability (Optional)
- See if you have trouble with [this quiz](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/probability-library/modal/e/probability_1).
    - If so, then  watch  the videos for [Khan Academy: basic probability section](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/probability-library#basic-theoretical-probability). 
    - Continue with videos/articles/quizzes from Khan Academy's [experimental probability](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/probability-library#experimental-probability-lib) and [randomness, probability, and simulation](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/probability-library#randomness-probability-and-simulation)

- For a longer introduction instead (~5 hours), try [DataCamp: Foundations of Probability in Python](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/foundations-of-probability-in-python). Prioritize your time to complete the statistics foundation course, however. 

### Optional Reading
- The [Khan Academy: Statistics & Probability](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability) course is a great resource to get another video on any concepts that are challenging. Seek out what you need more help on, and your TAs are here to help.
